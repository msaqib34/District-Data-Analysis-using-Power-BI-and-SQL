District Data Analysis

This is a practice exercise provided by someone to solve a problem and analyze the data. The goal is to present a complete report.

In this project, I performed various tasks. I examined e-stamp and other stamp sales, calculated their ratios, and looked into vehicle sales in the district. Additionally, I assessed the use of public transport and the movement of people within cities.
